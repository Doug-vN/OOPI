# OBJECT ORIENTED PERIPHERAL INTERFACE (OOPI) <img src="./docs/Processor_support_badge.png">

OOPI is an SPI interface designed to facilitate communication between a master module and a sensor slave module. The interface aims to encapsulate and abstract the communications infrastructure so as to yield human-readable code which is naturally robust to erroneous implementation. Furthermore, OOPI is designed to function without the master module requiring knowledge of the nature of the attached sensor, which allows for the continuing, community-driven development of SoliCamb-compatibile sensors without neccessitating major firmware patches to the master module. Further information on the API can be found in the [summary](SUMMARY.md)
